## Hi there 👋

*stocnet* is an open software system for the advanced statistical analysis of social networks.
Its history reaches [back to 1998](https://stocnet.gmw.rug.nl/content/project.htm),
but its new guise as a github organisation is since the start of 2024.
It currently includes the following software:

- [manynet](https://github.com/stocnet/manynet)
- [migraph](https://github.com/stocnet/migraph)
- [goldfish](https://github.com/stocnet/goldfish)
- [rsiena](https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena)

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
