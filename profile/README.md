## Welcome üëã

*stocnet* is an open software system for the advanced statistical analysis of social networks.
Its history reaches [back to 1998](https://stocnet.gmw.rug.nl/content/project.htm),
but its new guise as a github organisation is since the start of 2024.
It currently includes the following software:

- [manynet](https://github.com/stocnet/manynet) provides many fundamental tools for working with many (if not most) types, formats, and classes of networks. These include functions for _making_ networks (e.g. importing existing data, generating various random graphs), _modifying_ networks (e.g. reformatting, transforming, splitting, and joining), to easy _mapping_ for visualising graphs with sensible and flexible default individually, comparatively, and dynamically.
- [migraph](https://github.com/stocnet/migraph) builds on `{manynet}` to enable network analysis and modelling of multimodal, multilevel, and multilayer networks. It includes a range of measures that all work for one- and two-mode networks, their nodes and ties, algorithms for identifying motifs and community or equivalence memberships in them, and modelling one- and two-mode networks with multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MRQAP).
- [goldfish](https://github.com/stocnet/goldfish) offers tools for applying statistical models to network/relational event data, time-stamped sequences of interactions or affiliations between actors or entities within a network. In addition to relational event models (REMs), the package includes rate, choice, and coordination processes for one- and two-mode dynamic network actor models (DyNAMs) and dynamic network actor models for interactions (DyNAMi).
- [rsiena](https://github.com/stocnet/rsiena)
- [MoNAn](https://github.com/stocnet/MoNAn)
- [ERPM](https://github.com/stocnet/ERPM) extends exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for partitions, i.e. sets of non-overlapping groups, such as face-to-face interactions, animal herds, political coalitions, etc. This model can be used to explain cross-sectional or longitudinal observed partitions through group formation processes based on individual attributes, relations between individuals, and size-related factors.

We welcome contributions to any of these packages.
Contributions might take the form of raising issues (bugs or features), discussing different options,
or proposing changes to the codebase.
